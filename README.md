<h1>A web application with Django</h1>

<p>This is my attempt to follow the instruction from Python Crash Course book to build a simple Web Application with Django</p>
<p>The repo contains all the example code needed to run the Web Application.</p>
<p>The guide and related instruction can be found in Chapter 18 to 20 in Python Crash Course (version 2016.1)</p>
<p>The code in this repo has some minor change to adapt with Django version.</p>

<p>To run this repo:</p>
  <li>- Clone the repo to your computer </li>
  <li>- Create and activate a virtual machine using pyvenv (Recommended) </li>
  <li>- Install Django suitable for your Python version</li>
  <li>- Open a terminal in the repo folder and run >> python manage.py runserver</li>
<p>Any other description of the Web Application can be found in the book.</p>
