<h1>A web application with Django</h1>

<p>
This is my attempt to follow the instruction from Python Crash Course book to build a simple Web Application with Django
The repo contains all the example code needed to run the Web Application.
The guide and related instruction can be found in Chapter 18 to 20 in Python Crash Course (version 2016.1)
The code in this repo has some minor change to adapt with Django version.
</p>

<p>
To run this repo:
  <li>
  - Clone the repo to your computer
  - Create and activate a virtual machine using pyvenv (Recommended)
  - Install Django suitable for your Python version
  - Open a terminal in the repo folder and run >> python manage.py runserver
  </li>
Any other description of the Web Application can be found in the book.
